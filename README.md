==What is Perceive?==
Percieve is a haptic feedback bracelet that can be controlled via the api documented in this repository.

==How Is It Made?==
Percieve was made from scratch (ideation to functional demo) in 8 hours. This is how:

===Mechanical Components===
The bracelet was 3D printed using the help of Motorola X Labs (now working on project Ara)

===Electrical Components===
Four normal vibration motors were purchsed from radio shack
A free elctric imp given out by Electric Imp was used (it is amazing, check it out)

===Code===
We wrote a basic api in the electric imp server found in the electric imp folder, written in squirrel
We also wrote a beautiful static page that uses REST and JS to talk to the elctric imp api, which is this repo
Latency between clicking a key and feeling the vibration was not humanly noticiable

==Recognition==
We got free google headphones since Borris (Google Evangelist and Executive) really loved us :D
We placed within the top 10 at the hackathon as chosen by judges, but did not win the popular choice Top 3
